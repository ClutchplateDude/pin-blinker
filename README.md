# pin-blinker
Arduino sketch to blink pins entered through serial monitor.
Serial Monitor will prompt for a pin number.

Enter either Axx where xx is the pin number between 0 and 15, or D0-D65, or just plain pin numbers. 

The D pin numbers correspond to the actual pin numbers, so D21 and 21 are the same pin.
